<p>Hello, I am Cameron Boutin and I am in my second year of the Masters in World History program at Northeastern University. I also completed my undergraduate degree at Northeastern and once I graduate in the Winter 2016 I hope to pursue my PhD. The area of study that I am interested in is the American Civil War, and I particularly want to analyze the conflict from an environmnetal perspective.</p>
