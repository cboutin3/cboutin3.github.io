<h1>Cameron Boutin</h1>

<p>Hello, my name is Cameron Boutin and I am in my second year of the Masters in World History program at Northeastern University. I also completed my undergraduate degree at Northeastern and once I graduate in the Winter 2016 I hope to pursue my PhD. The area of study that I am interested in is the American Civil War, and I particularly want to analyze the conflict from an environmnetal perspective.</p>

<p>Some of my Favorite Civil War Authors</p>
<ul>Shelby Foote, Stephen Sears, Peter Cozzens, Gordon Rhea, James McPherson</ul>
